Donovan Osborne. Mr. Osborne has a very heavy english accent. Mr Osborne constantly goes to revolutionary war reenactments and may know how to use a flintlock rifle.
Vladimir. Mr.Corpse hired Vladimir to fix his rooftop, since it was heavily damaged. Mr.Corpse also called me to fix his garden outside of his house. I came over with my best hammer to fix the roof and my best sickle to help with the garden. I came to find Mr.Corpse in an dark alley adjacent to his house.  Mr wang was already and told me that he called the cops.
Justin Trudeau. Justin is an immigrant that owns a snow shoveling buisiness. He never liked Mr.Corpse since Mr.Corpse underpaid him. However Justin would never kill him.
Knot A. Corpse. Evaluation. There appears to be nothing on there but that's not enough. The murderer could have stabbed Mr. Corpse and patched him up. Looking at this recent medical records he had a surgery five days ago so he has stitches on his stomach. However maybe the murderer knew this. So there is still a chance of physical violence.
