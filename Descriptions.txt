Hammer. This hammer is made Russians so he might have used it. The brand is Czernobog. Very good for nailing wood but if needed can be used as a weapon. If so, he shall done for in the American court of law. 
Could this money be a clue? How does he have so much money? Did he steal from Mr. Corpse's? Or did he earn like hard a working American citizen.
Cane. This is a walking cane. Why? Is there an old person struggling to walk. NO way an old person would never kill somebody. Or would they?
Sickle. They brought the sickle to tend to Mr.Corpse's garden. Could this weapon be the item he used or could somebody have stolen it whilst they were fixing the rooftop?
The camera could have been thrown at the victim so that the victim would have been temporaily stunned. A perfect assault weapon.
Jewlery. Mr. Corpse had quite an extravagant collection of such necklaces. Could this man have stolen it from him? Or did he buy it from the store?
