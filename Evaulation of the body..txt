Knot A. Koarspuh. Evaluation. There appears to be nothing on there but that's not enough. The murderer could have stabbed Mr. Corpse and patched him up. Looking at this recent medical records he had a surgery five days ago so he has stitches on his stomach. However maybe the murderer knew this. So there is still a chance of physical violence.
